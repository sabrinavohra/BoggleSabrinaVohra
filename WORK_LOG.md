| 1/6  |  9:15 - 9:45am   |                                                  I started thinking about the problem by talking with my classmates and looking through previous code. We thought about using either BFS or DFS. |
| 1/6  |  9:45 - 9:55am   |                                                                                                                  We started honing in on the idea of DFS with a trie as the solution to attempt. |
| 1/6  | 10:35 - 10:45pm  |                                                                                                                                           I updated the test cases per Mr. Blick's instructions. |
| 1/6  | 10:45 -  11:00pm |                           I wrote some pseudocode using the DFS search idea by looking back at MazeSolver and connecting ideas to the problem at hand. I created the Trie and added words to it. |
| 1/7  |  2:20 - 2:45pm   |                                                I started working on the recursive DFS method after discussing in class. I created the Trie and Node classes. I also created the dictionary Trie. |
| 1/7  |  2:45 - 3:00pm   |                                                                                                                                              I started coding the test cases for the dfs method. |
| 1/7  | 10:40 - 10:50pm  | I wrote a basic version of DFS by looking at the psuedocode. I haven't yet figured out how to keep track of the words that are found in the method dfs and return those back to the main method. |
| 1/7  | 10:50 - 11:05pm  |                                                                   I continued debugging and was able to solve some smaller errors. The code runs but does not have the correct solution lengths. |
| 1/9  |  1:00 - 1:45pm   |                                                                                                                                   I continued working through the code to find where the bug is. |
| 1/12 |  12:55 - 1:20pm  |                                            I debugged and was able to find the solution for 4/6 test cases. I had made an error with the lookup method I used to find correct words in the trie. |
| 1/13 | 10:25 - 10:35am  |                                                                                                                                                                                I wrote comments. |
| 1/13 |     10:35 -      |                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
