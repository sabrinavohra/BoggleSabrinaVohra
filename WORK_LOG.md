| 1/6  |  9:15 - 9:45am   |                        I started thinking about the problem by talking with my classmates and looking through previous code. We thought about using either BFS or DFS. |
| 1/6  |  9:45 - 9:55am   |                                                                                        We started honing in on the idea of DFS with a trie as the solution to attempt. |
| 1/6  | 10:35 - 10:45pm  |                                                                                                                 I updated the test cases per Mr. Blick's instructions. |
| 1/6  | 10:45 -  11:00pm | I wrote some pseudocode using the DFS search idea by looking back at MazeSolver and connecting ideas to the problem at hand. I created the Trie and added words to it. |
| 1/7  |  2:20 - 2:45pm   |                      I started working on the recursive DFS method after discussing in class. I created the Trie and Node classes. I also created the dictionary Trie. |
| 1/7  |  2:45 - 3:00pm   |                                                                                                                    I started coding the test cases for the dfs method. |
